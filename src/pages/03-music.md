As a 17 year old adolescent i was so impressed by Nirvana and Kurt Cobain, that i got together with some friends and we made a band. Because i was already capable of singing since my 4th birthday - i imitated songs from the radio for the kids in our town and sang in church -, i started learning guitar. Later playing the drums joined. But even i am familiar with everything that has strings or drumheads, i see myself more as a composer and producer.

When it comes to musical genres, i am interested in everything which impresses me by its musicality. (So Schlager is out!) To name a few: Alternative, Technical Death Metal, Fusion, but also dark classical music and eletronic music like Minimal. My favourite bands are: Nirvana (still number one), The Beatles, The Police, The Doors, Marc Bolan & T-Rex, Led Zeppelin, Toto, Periphery, Tesseract, Max Cooper and many more. The musicians which influenced me most are: Kurt Cobain, Marc Bolan, John Bonham, Robby Krieger, Andy Summers, Dave Weckl and some more.

My own musics genre is Alternative/Crossover and Adult Oriented Rock with a strong 80s influence. I always wanted to be shouter in a metal band, but that dream has been unfulfilled.
