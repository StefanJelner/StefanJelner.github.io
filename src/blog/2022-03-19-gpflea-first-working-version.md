# First working version of gpFlea

## <time datetime="2022-03-19 10:30">March 19th 2022</time>

After some days of concentrated work, i finished an early version of **gpFlea (GitHub Pages Flea) is a superdupertiny flea size zero config static site generator for GitHub Pages**.

The need arose, when i wanted to create a GitHub page with the most simple approach i could possibly think of.

This page is already created with it and so far everything works well. What is missing are:

- better error handling if something goes wrong
- more tests on windows, because some file operations still seem to be unstable (especially when running after changes.)
- a complete `README.md`
- [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) in the code
- unit tests
- npm release

So there is still a lot to do to make it a real library which could be useful for others. As usual documentation and unit testing might take longer then the actual development of the library itself.
