# Release of RIsland.js 0.0.6

## <time datetime="2022-03-12 13:08">March 13th 2022</time>

Today was the release of version 0.0.6 which introduces a complete rewrite of the error and warning handling, more documentation and Jest unit tests up to an esoteric level. With these changes RIsland.js is considered stable and well tested. The only things which will be added from now on are more examples. In a few weeks (or months), if there are no issues or complaints, it will switch to a first stable version 1.0.0.
