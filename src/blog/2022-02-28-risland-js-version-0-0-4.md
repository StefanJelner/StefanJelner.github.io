# Release of RIsland.js 0.0.4

## <time datetime="2022-02-28 18:10">February 28th 2022</time>

Today was the release of Version 0.0.4 which introduces a warning, if the squirrelly template is malformed and adds local storage support to the todo list example.
RIsland is now in a state, that it can be used without things not working and the software engineer not knowing what is going wrong, which just adds unnecessary hurdles.

Besides the three examples with the sortable and filterable table, the todo list with drag&drop and the funny tetris clone are a first approach to show, what RIsland is capable of with a few lines of code.
